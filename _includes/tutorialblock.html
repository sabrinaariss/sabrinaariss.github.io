# Tutorial: How to Enable 7.1 Surround Sound in Logitech G533 Headphones for Windows 10
Your Logitech G533 Headphones features 7.1 channel virtual surround sound. Unless you enable the 7.1 channels after connecting the headphones, you will get a stereo output from your PC or laptop. This tutorial will teach you how to enable surround sound in your headphones for Windows 10. First, we need to enable surround in the Logitech HUB app.
## How to Configure Surround Sound in Logitech HUB
1. Download the Logitech G HUB app. You can find it here: [Logitech G HUB Advanced Gaming Software, RGB & Game Profiles](https://www.logitechg.com/en-nz/innovation/g-hub.html)
2. Click on Download for Windows, and follow the onboarding instructions.
3. Once the application is installed, plug your headphones into any USB port on your PC or laptop.
4. The G HUB application will recognize your device, and G533 will appear in the portal. Click on the image of your headphones:

## How to Configure Surround Sound in Windows 10
1. Press the Windows key and the R key to open a Run window. In the Open box, type “mmsys.cpl”. Click OK to open the Sound Properties.
