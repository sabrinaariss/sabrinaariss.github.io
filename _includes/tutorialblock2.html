          ## Troubleshooting

*My headphones aren’t appearing in the Logitech HUB.* 
- The computer has not registered the headphones. Remove the USB and re-insert it. Alternatively, remove the USB, restart your computer, and then re-insert the USB.
 
*The Logitech HUB says my headphones are inactive.*
- Switch the power button on the headphones off and then on again. 
Alternatively, open and close the headphone’s microphone arm.

*My Speaker Setup window only has a Stereo option, not a 7.1 Surround option.*
- Your headphones have not been configured in the Logitech G HUB. Download the HUB and configure the headphones in there first. See the beginning of this tutorial for directions.
